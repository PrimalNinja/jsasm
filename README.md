# JSASM - JavaScript Assembler

JSASM is an assembler for JavaScript that can run inside a browser but also translate to multiple target platforms.  It can run within JS by way of simulating I/O to act upon different aspects of the browser, e.g. keyboard input or canvas output.  Memory models can be configured completely also and it uses a combination of memory instructions that manipulate simulated memory as well as strings within JS. 

The project started as an experiment and a few good feedbacks so far might be enough for this project to continue.

Most instructions are implemented and some investigations into the best way to handle the different target CPUs has proven to work reasonably well on paper, however there are no currently translated targets.
